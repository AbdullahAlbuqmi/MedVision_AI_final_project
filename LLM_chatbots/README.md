Medical AI Chatbots
We developed two intelligent medical chatbots designed to assist doctors in clinical decision-making, disease-specific analysis, and medical data exploration. These AI systems support doctors by providing rapid insights, generating condition-focused responses, and enhancing medical workflow efficiency.

Our Models:
```bash
Model 1 — TinyLlama
	•	TinyLlama-1.1B · LoRa Efficient-Parameters Fine tuned using medical data from Huggingface · Guardrails + translation layers to support Arabic

Model 2 — DeepSeek
	•	DeepSeek 3.2v · Safety-guarded medical instruct · Bilingual (Arabic / English)
```

Deployment:
- TinyLlama: Deployed via Google colab
- DeepSeek: Deployed on Huggingface

Both models can be deployed and Hosted locally, but they require a high-performance GPU
